# Coffee-Production-Analysis

In this project, I worked with a dataset from a CSV file containing information about coffee production. After importing the data, I focused on cleaning it to ensure accuracy. Then, I conducted various statistical analyses to uncover insights into coffee production trends across different countries from 1990 to 2018. 

To make the findings more understandable, I used visualization techniques. I created visualizations to compare the coffee production of different countries. One of the key visualizations was a line chart that depicted the performance of the top coffee-producing nations over the years. This allowed me to track their progress and changes in production levels.

Furthermore, I specifically studied Brazil's coffee production by comparing it to the rest of the world. I employed a stack plot to visually represent this comparison on a yearly basis. By doing this, I was able to showcase Brazil's contribution in relation to other countries in the global coffee production landscape.

In conclusion, this project delved into coffee production data from 1990 to 2018, involving data cleaning, statistical analysis, and insightful visualizations. The main goal was to grasp the trends and patterns in coffee production among various nations and to highlight Brazil's role in comparison to the rest of the world.

### Objective of Analysis
<br>

>Which country emerged as the leading coffee producer among the top nations, and what was the difference in coffee production between the top two countries?

>How did the coffee production of the top nation evolve over the years, and were there any significant trends or fluctuations in its production levels?

>Through the stack plot, how does Brazil's yearly coffee production compare to the combined production of the rest of the world, and are there any specific years that stand out in terms of Brazil's contribution?

Among the top coffee-producing nations, Brazil dominated with a substantial total production of 1,190,965.74 metric tons. Vietnam followed with 439,540.95 metric tons, while Colombia and Indonesia contributed 345,871.45 and 245,116.77 metric tons, respectively. Ethiopia rounded off the list with 141,542.89 metric tons. This data showcases Brazil's significant lead in the global coffee production landscape, and the disparity between its output and that of other leading nations. Additionally, the large gap between Brazil and the second-ranking Vietnam indicates Brazil's crucial role in shaping the coffee industry's dynamics.

<br>
In the dataset spanning 1990 to 1994, Brazil consistently led in total coffee production, with a steady rise from 27,285.63 to 28,192.05 metric tons. Vietnam and Colombia followed with varying production levels each year. Interestingly, Vietnam's production gradually increased, showcasing its growing role. Colombia's production fluctuated, possibly due to changing factors. Indonesia and Ethiopia maintained relatively stable production levels. These insights highlight Brazil's dominance, Vietnam's upward trajectory, and the production dynamics of the other nations during this period.

The dataset from 1990 to 2018 reveals interesting trends in global coffee production. Brazil consistently holds the lead, producing significantly more than the rest of the world combined. Over the years, Brazil's production experienced fluctuations, reaching a peak in 2018. The rest of the world maintained a more stable production pattern. Notably, both Brazil and the rest of the world experienced slight declines in 2015. The overall trajectory suggests that while Brazil's production has its ups and downs, it plays a pivotal role in shaping the global coffee production landscape, driving fluctuations in the total production output.
