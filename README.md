# Coffee-Production-Analysis

In this project, I worked with a dataset from a CSV file containing information about coffee production. After importing the data, I focused on cleaning it to ensure accuracy. Then, I conducted various statistical analyses to uncover insights into coffee production trends across different countries from 1990 to 2018. 

To make the findings more understandable, I used visualization techniques. I created visualizations to compare the coffee production of different countries. One of the key visualizations was a line chart that depicted the performance of the top coffee-producing nations over the years. This allowed me to track their progress and changes in production levels.

Furthermore, I specifically studied Brazil's coffee production by comparing it to the rest of the world. I employed a stack plot to visually represent this comparison on a yearly basis. By doing this, I was able to showcase Brazil's contribution in relation to other countries in the global coffee production landscape.

In conclusion, this project delved into coffee production data from 1990 to 2018, involving data cleaning, statistical analysis, and insightful visualizations. The main goal was to grasp the trends and patterns in coffee production among various nations and to highlight Brazil's role in comparison to the rest of the world.
